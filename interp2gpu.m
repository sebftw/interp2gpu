function Vq = interp2gpu(V, Xq, Yq, method)
%INTERP2GPU interpolation for 2-D gridded gpuArray data, based on interp2.
%
%  [Vq] = interp2gpu(V, Xq, Yq, method) is equivalent to 
%  [Vq] = interp2(V, Xq, Yq, method, 0)
% 
% This means
% 1) No extrapolation is used. Outside values are set to zero.
% 2) Assumes a unit-spaced grid: X=1:N and Y=1:M where [M,N]=SIZE(V, 1:2).
%
% It supports an additional method on GPU:
% [Vq] = interp2gpu(V, Xq, Yq, 'spline_approx') fast approximate spline.
%
% Batching is supported for spline interpolation! A GPU is high-throughput,
% so interpolating a [M,N,K]=SIZE(V, 1:3) video will be much faster than
% processing each frame individually.

% TODO: We do not support all the call signatures of interp2 (e.g. Xq, Yq
% vectors), and we should also verify that non-complex input works as well.
